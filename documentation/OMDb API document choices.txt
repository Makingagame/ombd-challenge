Used Google API Material Icons to get the magnifying glass icon - credit is not required.

Decsision made to use Google API jquery (so I won't have to download and run it on my end) - this could help with queriying JSON data.

Will have a Navbar Div that is split in two.
	* Left side for the search bar
	* Right side for the other filters
	*(Need to update this to three columns)

Will have two columns for main body content, as resembling wireframe
Will use cards in ul/li elements (so they can be clicked) for searched movie list

To search, an onkeyup event will trigger an API call (an API call every key pressed)
Also allow any filter button being pressed to trigger an API call

After considering how to retain watchlist information between sessions, explored whether React.js should be used
Decision made against React.js, javascript is fine on it's own.

Downloaded node.js 12.13.0
Downloaded nvm and gitbash

Followed a few different tutorials for others' implementations of omdb api movie search apps

Project most closely followed/code used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUUSwCAUF0k

Built HTML filters, slider, radiot buttons, built basic API Query

Multi-thumb sliders are complicated!! Found the jQuery UI range slider, but had problems making it work (not formatted correctly).
Chose another slider import which functioned fine - but did not look the same as the wireframe.
Settled on currently used slider, found here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfSYmk_6vk8&ab_channel=CodingArtist

Updated API Query to include filters and return more than one movie

Tweaked the slider, set beginning year and end year to as they are in wireframe. 
Estimated intended beginning year would be 1930 and end year would be 2030 (application is VERY unlikely to remain un-updated for a decade)

Added a text box for Season No. so that episodes could be searched properly

Used new async "fetch" function. Added cards with html, css and javascript.
Overhauled javascript, added cards html and css, added watchlist.

Fixed a number of bugs, overall formatting work and tweaks.
Created Expand Details section (clicking on movie in the left section brings it up in more detail on the right)

Used debouncing on function to stop search function issue
