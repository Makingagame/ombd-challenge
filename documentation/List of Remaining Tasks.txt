Make whole movie card clickable instead of just the title
Make whole card highlight when clicked
Add more accessibility features (alt text for images, links etc.)
Add movie slider so you can scroll through the searched movies on the left (or make all elements absolute except left body)
Format radio button section correctly
Watchlist.html doesn't display all needed information


Consolidate these: (((

Add "Too many results..." message 

Add "No results..." message
IF ARRAY IS EMPTY SEND THIS MESSAGE

)))


ISSUE: When typing quickly, multiple search functions can be triggered at the same time, which results in cloned results
(two of the same movie will appear in search list) - need to add some sort of "wait" element, even if it's just for 200ms
^^^ CAN PRESS ENTER INSTEAD



WHAT'S THE FONT
COLOURS OKAY


Slider Okay?










CRITICAL TASKS:

RESULTS ISSUE:
1. TAKES A REALLY LONG TIME WITH STAR WARS
2. Sometimes the number is a few off (usually the first time only)

WIREFRAME RESEMBLANCE TASKS
3. Year Slider numbers should be moved to either side of the slider

4. Re-format entire right section of screen where movie is displayed (move and redesign 'Watchlist' button, add a border around Rating, configure other movie details according to wireframe image)

NICE-TO-HAVE TASKS
5. Add "Too many results..." (FALSE ERROR) and "No results..." (FORMAT) messages to display on the left section of the page when appropriate. 

6. ADD "SEARCHING" or "Loading Page x"





Add pages to the movie app, 10 movies per page, so you can see every movie searched

Add more accessibility features (alt text for images, movie posters, buttons, etc.)

Find the exact font used in the wireframe and use it in the application
