Make whole movie card clickable instead of just the title
Make whole card highlight when clicked
Add more accessibility features (alt text for images, links etc.)
Add movie slider so you can scroll through the searched movies on the left (or make all elements absolute except left body)
Format radio button section correctly
Watchlist.html doesn't display all needed information
Add 'Results' text
Ratings section in detailsCard
Add "Too many results..." message 

ISSUE: When typing quickly, multiple search functions can be triggered at the same time, which results in cloned results
(two of the same movie will appear in search list) - need to add some sort of "wait" element, even if it's just for 200ms
