Make whole movie card clickable instead of just the title
Make whole card highlight when clicked
Add more accessibility features (alt text for images, links etc.)
Add movie slider so you can scroll through the searched movies on the left (or make all elements absolute except left body)
Format radio button section correctly
Watchlist.html formatting is currently terrifying (movie posters overlap, not all information is displayed)
Add 'Results' text
Ratings section in detailsCard


ISSUE: When typing quickly, multiple search functions can be triggered at the same time, which results in cloned results
(two of the same movie will appear in search list) - need to add some sort of "wait" element, even if it's just for 200ms

ISSUE: Both add and remove watchlist buttons appear when on the Watchlist.html page (not sure why yet)
