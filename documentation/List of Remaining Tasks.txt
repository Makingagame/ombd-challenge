Make whole movie card clickable instead of just the title
Make whole card highlight when clicked
Add more accessibility features (alt text for images, links etc.)
Add movie slider so you can scroll through the searched movies on the left (or make all elements absolute except left body)
Format radio button section correctly
Watchlist.html doesn't display all needed information



Add 'Results' text
HOW GET MORE THAN 10

Ratings section in detailsCard

Consolidate these: (((

Add "Too many results..." message 

Add "No results..." message
IF ARRAY IS EMPTY SEND THIS MESSAGE

)))


ISSUE: When typing quickly, multiple search functions can be triggered at the same time, which results in cloned results
(two of the same movie will appear in search list) - need to add some sort of "wait" element, even if it's just for 200ms
^^^ CAN PRESS ENTER INSTEAD



WHAT'S THE FONT
COLOURS OKAY


Slider Okay?
