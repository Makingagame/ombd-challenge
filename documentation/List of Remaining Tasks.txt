Make whole movie card clickable instead of just the title
Make whole card highlight when clicked
Add more accessibility features (alt text for images, links etc.)
Add movie slider so you can scroll through the searched movies on the left (or make all elements absolute except left body)
Format radio button section correctly
Watchlist.html doesn't display all needed information


Consolidate these: (((

Add "No results..." message
IF ARRAY IS EMPTY SEND THIS MESSAGE

^^^ CAN PRESS ENTER INSTEAD



WHAT'S THE FONT
COLOURS OKAY


Slider Okay?
