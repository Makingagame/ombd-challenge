CSS ISSUES:
1. Highlighted inside of radio buttons is not always centered when zooming out/in. May 	need to change px values to % values

2. When scrolling out the watchlist content on watchlist.html will move to the left side of the screen instead of staying centered

3. Very few accessibility features (alt text for images, movie posters, buttons, etc.)

4. Very few CSS classes for Safari/Firefox

5. The left-hand-side card's bottom borders should be overlapping through the scroll bar

6. Could add an image to be displayed when one cannot be found from the api

7. Exact fonts/colours used in the wireframe should be used in the application

8. When multiple movie details are N/A (ratings, plot, actors) the formatting of the expanded details of the movie on the right side of the screen can start overlapping

9. CSS could always be cleaned, there are some unused values, such as when values are stated but their inherited value is the same


CODE ISSUES:
1. I have noticed sometimes the number is a few off (usually the first time a phrase is searched only)

2. Could have included Throw/Catch Error Handlers
