Hi, thanks for reading me!

1. 	Just a few quick technical considerations: 
		* This movie app was only designed to display correctly on Chrome/Edge. 
		* Node 12 and some jQuery was used in it's creation.

2.	In the 'documentation' folder of this project you can find:
		* Next Issues to Work On.txt: Covers the defects/potential improvements that I am aware of. I believe the submission meets all the requirements listed and displays my skills/ability to work off of a client brief.

		* OMDb API Choices Made.txt: There is no real documentation for this project as I considered this outside the scope of the challenge, however this document covers major decisions made during design/building/testing.


3.	I tried my best to make the application as close to the wireframe as possible, but I had to add some things for functionality:
		* Season Text Box: You cannot search for episodes without inputting a Season number, I wanted the user to have control over which Season they search for.
		* Watchlist Link/Header: Adding a header with a link to the Watchlist page seemed like the most natural way for users to find it.


4. 	Some details of movies have changed since wireframe screencap was taken: 
		* Tomatometer is no longer supported by OMDB Api.
		* Details for Star wars movies have changed (movie titles, plot details, listed actors, etc.).


5. 	In the documentation folder I have included a screencap of how the application displays on my screen. It may appear different on smaller/larger screens and I have not been able to test it thoroughly.
